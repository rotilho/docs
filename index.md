# Welcome to Atto Documentation

Atto is live, feeless digital cash built for payments. It confirms quickly, has no protocol transaction fees, and keeps consensus lightweight enough for everyday use.

## Quick Start

## Core Documentation

### [Whitepaper](/docs/whitepaper)
The technical overview of Atto's consensus, account-chain model, supply, and security assumptions.

- Open Representative Voting (ORV) consensus
- Account-chain architecture
- Anti-spam mechanism via lightweight PoW
- Fixed supply of 18B coins (no new minting)
- Representative voting rather than competitive proof-of-work mining for consensus

### [Token Distribution](/docs/distribution)
How Atto enters circulation through the faucet, Folding@Home mining, staking rewards, and contribution rewards. Rates and eligibility follow the current reward policy. The published [Growth Stability Index (GSI)](/docs/growth-stability-index) design can scale configured rates; current route mappings require operational confirmation.

- Faucet for new users
- Folding@Home mining for research contributors
- Staking rewards for eligible accounts delegated to participating voters
- Contribution rewards for useful work

## Distribution and Reward Routes

:::note Reward availability
Reward eligibility, rates, and timing depend on the current rules for each route and may change.

## Key Features

### Instant Transactions
Atto does not wait for a shared block queue. Transactions are processed as they reach the network, and the current median/P50 confirmation time is about <a href="/metrics#confirmation-speed"><Metric name="network.confirmation-time.ms.seven-day-p50" precision={0} suffix=" ms" /></a>. A transaction may be treated as confirmed when it satisfies the network's then-current voting rules. Confirmation and recovery still depend on software, voting-weight distribution, connectivity, infrastructure, and operating conditions.

### Zero Fees
Atto has no protocol transaction fee. If you send 1 ATTO, the recipient receives 1 ATTO. That makes small payments, tips, faucets, and everyday transfers practical instead of being eaten by fixed network fees.

### Lightweight Consensus
Consensus is voting, not mining. Each transaction includes a small proof-of-work to slow spam, but representatives decide confirmation through **Open Representative Voting (ORV)**. The result is a payment network that stays lightweight without turning security into an energy race.

### Secure & Decentralized
Each account controls its own chain of transactions, and conflicting updates are resolved by representative votes. Delegation assigns representatives voting weight without transferring custody of the account's funds.

### Scalable
Atto uses account chains instead of one shared block queue. Independent accounts can move in parallel, so the network is not forced to serialize every payment through a single global block.

## Use Cases

- Micropayments for pay-per-use services, content tips, and in-app purchases
- Retail payments where checkout needs fast confirmation and no network fee
- Remittances where the sender should not lose value to fixed transfer fees
- Machine-to-machine payments for small automated transfers
- Gaming balances, item trades, donations, and tips

## How Atto Works

### Open Representative Voting (ORV)
Instead of mining blocks, Atto holders delegate voting weight to representatives they trust. Representatives vote on the validity of transactions and confirm the winning state.

### Account Chains
Each account has its own chain of transactions. That lets independent accounts move in parallel instead of waiting for a single global block queue.

### Anti-Spam Protection
To prevent spam without fees, Atto requires a small proof-of-work for each transaction. The work is lightweight for normal use but makes bulk spam more expensive.

### Fixed Supply
The full 18 billion ATTO supply was created at genesis. No new coins can be minted; distribution programs move that existing supply into circulation over time.
